 🌍 Presenting my latest full-stack project – Wanderlust.
I built a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, where users can explore, create, and manage travel stays. The project demonstrates end-to-end development with modern technologies and includes several key features:

🔹 Tech Stack: JavaScript, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap, CSS
🔹 Architecture: Implemented using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for clean and maintainable code
🔹 Authentication & Authorization: Secure login, signup, and role-based access control
🔹 Interactive Maps: Integrated Mapbox API (Geocoding) to display dynamic locations on maps
🔹 User Experience: Responsive and user-friendly design with Bootstrap and custom CSS
